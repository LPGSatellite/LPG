# LPG
LPG is a framework for protecting location privacy at the protocol layer operating on an anonymous academic satellite. 

The LEO satellite used in our experiments are not for commercial use, only for acadamic research. However, it replicates the satellite structure for COTS computing devices to minimize the impact of unrelated factors. Due to the double-blindness and licensing restrictions, we do not disclose all parameters, protocols and agreement contents of the satellite. We only make those contents that have no impact on the safety of satellite operation publicly available, and they can prove the conclusions and procedures of LPG. 

This repository provides artifacts about LPG, and it also could help the community understand how to conduct experiments on acadamic satellites. Upon acceptance we will continue to improve the repository within ethical considerations. 


## Hardware Settings




## On-Board Satellite Experiment Procedures

In [`On-Board-Satellite-Procedures`](https://github.com/LPGSatellite/LPG/tree/main/On-Board-Satellite-Procedures), we discussed the basic procedures of on-board experiments, covering ground instruction making, experiment process generation, result acquisition, experiment execution and other aspects. 

## Telemetry

In [`Telemetry`](https://github.com/LPGSatellite/LPG/tree/main/telemetry), we provide scripts for measuring temperature, power. They can measure the real-time results by comparing with the timestamp in the log. 

## Evaluation Data

In xx we provide the dataset and plotting code used in the LPG section 5 Evaluation.
